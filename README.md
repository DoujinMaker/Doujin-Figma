# Doujin Figma - A Figma Plugin that help you make your own drawing with Stable Diffusion using Colab

Free and open source plugin for you to use Figma with Stable Diffusion.
Made this plugin for my friends so that it is easier for them to draw their Dojin Manga.
I made another Design Assistant which is called Design Wingman but it is harder to setup.
While this plugin is easier to setup.

Follow the instruction and run all the cells.
Copy the generated URL at the very end of the Notebook and paste it onto the URL box on the very top of this plugin (Left side is URL, Right side is API keys).
For faster generate speed, it is recommended to use Stable Diffusion Turbo.
When you see the warning about Figma Extension, install the following plugin to your Stable Diffusion WebUi for full features if you want.
